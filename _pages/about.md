I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) (CUHK), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/). 
Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) (UMass) and the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/), as well as Prof. [Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/) at Harvard. 
Prior to this, I was also honored to be advised by Prof. [Chi-Wing Fu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/) at CUHK. 

My research experience covers various aspects of deep learning. Under the supervision of Prof. Chi-Wing Fu, I focused on low-level vision, self-supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning on shadow detection task.  With Prof. Chuang Gan, I expanded my work to include audio processing, autoencoders, generative models (e.g., diffusion model) and large language models. My most recent research with Prof. Chuang Gan and Yilun Du involves building a lifelong memory system for embodied agents to perform embodied question-answering and lifelong navigation tasks. 

My research interests lie in embodied AI and robot learning, with the ultimate goal of building human-like intelligent agents capable of navigating human environments and performing tasks with accuracy and robustness. Toward this goal, I am particularly interested in the following two topics: 1)	**Robotic perception**: The intelligent agent should be able to actively and continuously perceive its surroundings, explore and navigate for given tasks, and build representations to memorize the newly explored environment. 2)	**Interaction with the physical world**: The intelligent agent should possess both high-level decision-making and reasoning abilities, as well as robust low-level motion planning abilities, to accomplish complex tasks.
